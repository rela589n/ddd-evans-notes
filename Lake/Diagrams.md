Draw.io tool may be used for diagrams construction.

**Diagrams** are useful for **communication** and **brainstorming**. Diagram **is not a model** itself, it just **means for** model **explanation**.

There's no such thing as full object model diagram, as it would be too complex. It's better to have **multiple smaller diagrams** instead of one big.

**Unified Modeling Language** (UML):
- class diagrams;
- object interactions.

**Class diagram** - represents **objects structure** and relationships. Shows 
**classess** their **attributes**, **relationships**.

**Object interactions diagram** - represents **object** behavioral **responsibilities**. Shows **operations** flow between objects.
