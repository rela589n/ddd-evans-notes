Diagram **is not a [[Domain Model|model]]** itself, it just **means for** model **explanation**.

There's no such thing as full object model diagram, as it would be too complex. It's better to have **multiple smaller diagrams** instead of one big.

**Unified Modeling Language** (UML):
- [[Object interactions diagram|object interactions]];
- [[Class diagram|class diagrams]].
[[Object interactions diagram|object interactions]].
