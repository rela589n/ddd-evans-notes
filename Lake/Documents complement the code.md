The code itself is an unambiguous specification of the system. But the problem is:
- it is too detailed, this is not that easy to get the general overview of the design;
- not only developers should understand the model.

Oral communication is volatile and is if not persisted anywhere, the information is lost.

The documents should not be too verbose, since we have the code. They should **complement both code and communication**. Docs give insight to design decisions and large-scale structures.
