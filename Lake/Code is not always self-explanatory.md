XP relies exceptionally on code as the source of truth.

Even though code is the rigorous specification of the requirements, it does not always describe itself well. Classes, methods, variables may be named in misleading way. In some cases methods say completely different thing that is happening inside. The same comes to tests - it is not always clear what test is checking.

It takes self-discipline to keep code self-descriptive and use ubiquitous language.
