Both **domain experts** and **devs** have to communicate **single [[Ubiquitous Language|language]]**.

It should be **unambiguous** and **everyoune should stick** to its terms and descriptions. The more **pervasive language** is, the more **smooth** will be the **understanding flow**.

**Talk** about the system **in domain terms**, which are used inside of the model. Try to **simplify the expressions into terms** and then **bring** them to the **[[Diagrams]] and code**.

Domain experts should **object to awkward terms**, devs should **object to inconsistencies**.

If it is used **persistently**, then **weak points** will **float up**, which allows us to **replace terms** and descriptions **to become more clear**.
