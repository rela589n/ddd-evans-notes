# Communication and the Use of Language

Model-based communication **increases the utility** of written text **docs**. It improves the **communication through the code**.

## Ubiquitous Language

**Developers** working on the different parts of the problem **use** their **own design concepts** and ways of **describing the domain**.

As far as **domain experts** and **developers** use **different languages**, there's an **translation layer required**.  It blunts the communication. 

It's possible that **multiple terms** are used to describe **the same information**, while the most **incisive expressions** have only transient form and are **never written anywhere**.

The **domain model** can become a **backbone for the common language**.

**Ubuquitous Language** - includes **names for domain classess** and most prominent **methods**, **names of patterns** which are commonly applied by the team, **terms used to discuss the rules**.

The more **pervasive language** is, the more **smooth** will be the **understanding flow**. If it is used **persistently**, then **weak points** will **float up**, which allows us to **replace terms** and descriptions **to become more clear**.

> Use **model** as the **backbone of a language**. Make everyone in the team **use it everywhere**.
> Domain experts should **object to awkward terms**, devs should **object to inconsistencies**.

## Modeling Out Loud

**Talk** about the system **in domain terms**, which are used inside of the model. Try to **simplify the expressions into terms** and then **bring** them to the **diagrams and code**.

## One Team - One Language

Both **domain experts** and **devs** have to communicate **single language**.

If **experts** in the domain do **not understand** the **model**, there's something wrong with that model.  The **model** may **start awkward** and incomplete, but it will be **refined later on**. As model **language evolves**, experts must **adopt it** and **docs** have to be **retrofitted**.

Talking about the model is kind of testing it, as far as we can detect its incompleteness or vagueness.

The **ubiquitous language** is the **intersection** between dev's language and domain experts language. It is extended mostly by business terms (rather than dev terms).
